puppet-pam_radius_auth
Configures sshd and sudo PAM modules to use RADIUS for authentication.
Written by Roger Ignazio, rignazio at gmail dot com. 2012-07-07.

Overview:
  Installs and configures pam_radius_auth module for PAM to allow
  sshd and sudo to use RADIUS for authentication. As distributed,
  this will also fallback to local authentication (using localifdown)
  should the RADIUS servers be unavailable.

  Although the distributed copy only supports Redhat/CentOS and
  Debian/Ubuntu, this module should work, with minor modifications, on
  any system that supports PAM.


Prerequisites:
  On CentOS, the EPEL repo must be installed and enabled. Information on
  the EPEL repo is available at: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL


Configuration:
  Set the default servers, shared secret, and timeout in manifests/init.pp,
  then include the class for your node(s):

    node 'prod.example.com' {
      include pam_radius_auth
    }


  You may also override the defaults on a per-node basis:
    node 'test.example.com' {
      class { "pam_radius_auth":
        pam_radius_servers => [ "192.168.10.80",
                                "192.168.10.90" ],
        pam_radius_secret  => "sekrit",
        pam_radius_timeout => '5',
      }
    }
